Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

This is a challenge involving the use of third-party APIs to create a work day scheduler. When the planner is opened, the current day should be dislayed at the top of the calendar. When scrolling down, the user should be presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block should be color-coded to indicate past, present, or future. When a time block is clicked, the user should be able to enter an event. When the save button is clicked, the text for that event should be saved in the browser's local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events should persist on the webpage.

Screenshots of the application can be found in the Screenshots folder in the repository.
